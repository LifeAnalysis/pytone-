## Key Elements
- **Side Lanes**: Each player has two side lanes with 5 life points each
- **Champion Lane**: Middle lane containing the player's Champion Card
- **Monster Positions**: Front row positions for monster cards
- **Spell Positions**: Back row positions for spell cards

## Strategic Implications
- Monsters in the front row engage in direct combat
- Spells in the back row provide support effects
- Lane positioning determines valid attack patterns
- Side lanes must be broken before Champion can be attacked (with some exceptions)
